Microservices and REST:
What is a microservice and how does it differ from a monolithic architecture:
A microservice is a small, independently deployable service that focuses on a single business function. Unlike monolithic architecture, microservices allow
for decentralized data management,independent scaling, and deployment


Explain how RESTful web services work:
RESTful web services use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations. They represent resources as URIs and use stateless communication for
interoperability between clients and servers

What is Feign in the context of Spring Cloud:
Feign is a declarative web service client that simplifies HTTP API client creation by reducing boilerplate code and integrating seamlessly with Spring Cloud for 
load balancing and fault tolerance.

Describe the purpose of Hystrix and how it works:
Hystrix is a library for latency and fault tolerance in distributed systems. It isolates points of access to external systems, provides fallback mechanisms, 
and prevents cascading failures.

How does Spring Boot handle configuration management:
 Spring Boot handles configuration through application properties or YAML files, allowing externalized configuration and supporting profiles for 
environment-specific settings.

Encapsulation : Wrapping up of data and methods together is known as encapsulation. best example is class.Encapsulation is hiding the implementation of a class
behind a well defined interface.Encapsulation helps us to change implementation of a class without breaking other code.
(or)
It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class Encapsulation also involves 
restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data. Instead,
access to the data is typically provided through public methods, often referred to as getters and setters.

Benefits of Encapsulation
Control: Encapsulation provides control over the data by allowing you to define how it should be accessed and modified.
Flexibility: It allows the internal implementation of a class to be changed without affecting the code that uses the class.
Maintainability: Encapsulated code is easier to maintain and understand.
Security: It helps protect the integrity of the data by preventing unauthorized access and modification.

To achieve encapsulation in Java −
  -Declare the variables of a class as private.
  -Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

Abstraction:  hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. The main purpose of abstraction is to reduce
complexity and allow the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.
In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Abstraction is achieved in 2 ways:
 -Abstract class  -----classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and must be subclassed
 -Interfaces (Pure Abstraction)---contract of methods that a class must implement without providing the implementation itself.

Abstract Class:
 An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
 It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
 It cannot be instantiated.
 It can have constructors and static methods also.
 It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

Interfaces:
  All the fields in interfaces are public, static and final by default.
 All methods are public & abstract by default.
 A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the
interface.
 Interfaces support the functionality of multiple inheritance

if class is abstract,not mandatory to have abstract method
if abstract method implemented ,class should be abstract

Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different
underlying data. Precisely, Poly means‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’.
Types of Polymorphism IMP
1. Compile Time Polymorphism (Static)
2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic

Compile Time Polymorphism: The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Example - Method Overloading
Method Overloading: Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have morethan one function with the same function name but with different functionality.
Method overloading can be possible on the following basis:
1. The return type of the overloaded function.
2. The type of the parameters passed to the function.
3. The number of parameters passed to the function.

Runtime Polymorphism: Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism.Function Overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism.
Function Overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides 
the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. 
The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism

Inheritence:
Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods andfields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information
is made manageable in a hierarchical order.The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose 
properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

Types of inheritance in Java
On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and   hierarchical.
In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.

Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one superclass.
Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a subclass, forming a chain.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.
Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from more than one superclass (not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces).

why multiple inheritence not allowed in java?
Multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from more than one class, is not allowed in Java to avoid complexity and ambiguity that can arise from it
when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity in which version of a method from the 
common superclass should be inherited.

Exception handling
Exception handling in Java is a powerful mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of the program's execution. An exception is an event that 
disrupts the normal flow of the program. In Java, exceptions are objects that describe an exceptional (erroneous) condition that has occurred in a piece of code.

Key Concepts of Exception Handling
Try Block: The code that might throw an exception is placed inside the try block.
Catch Block: The code that handles the exception is placed inside the catch block.
Finally Block: This block is executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
Throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
Throws: Used in method signatures to declare the exceptions that a method can throw.


Stringbuffer and String Builder:
In Java, StringBuffer and StringBuilder are classes used to create mutable (modifiable) sequences of characters. Both are alternatives to the String class 
when frequent modifications to strings are needed, as String objects are immutable.

StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe and can be used safely in a multi-threaded environment. Synchronization ensures that only one thread 
can modify the StringBuffer object at a time.
StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it faster and more efficient than StringBuffer in single-threaded scenarios, but it is not thread-safe.

StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer because it does not have the overhead of synchronization.

how to create immutable class in java?
Creating an immutable class in Java means designing a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. Immutable objects are inherently 
thread-safe,as their state cannot change once they are constructed. Here's how to create an immutable class in Java:

Steps to Create an Immutable Class
Declare the class as final so it cannot be subclassed.
Make all fields private and final to ensure that their values cannot be modified after the object is constructed.
Provide a constructor that initializes all the fields.
Do not provide setters for any fields.
Ensure that mutable objects are not directly accessible from outside the class. This can be achieved by:
Returning copies of mutable objects rather than the objects themselves.
Ensuring that any passed mutable objects are not modified after being used to construct the immutable object.

Serialization:
Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream so that the byte stream can be reverted back into a copy of the object.
This process allows objects to be easily saved to files, sent over a network, or transferred between different components in a system.

Key Concepts:
Serializable Interface: An object can be serialized if its class or any of its superclasses implements the java.io.Serializable interface.
This is a marker interface, which means it does not contain any methods.

ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream: These classes are used to write objects to and read objects from streams, respectively.

SerialVersionUID: This is a unique identifier for each Serializable class. It is used during deserialization to ensure that a loaded class corresponds exactly 
to a serialized object. If no matching class is found, an InvalidClassException is thrown.

The == operator is used to compare primitive data types and object references in Java.
When used with primitive data types (such as int, double, char, etc.), == checks if the values of the variables are equal
When used with objects (non-primitive types), == compares the memory addresses (references) of the objects. It checks whether two object references point 
to the same memory location.

The .equals() method is used to compare the content or values of objects in Java. It is a method defined in the Object class and is overridden by most classes 
to provide meaningful comparison based on the content of the objects.

== is used for reference comparison, while .equals() is used for content comparison.


Java 8 Features:
functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. It serves as a blueprint for implementing lambda expressions or method references. 
Functional interfaces enable the use of lambda expressions, which provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions.

Characteristics of Functional Interfaces:
Single Abstract Method (SAM): A functional interface contains exactly one abstract method. It may also contain default methods and static methods introduced
in Java 8, but only one abstract method.

Lambda Expression Compatibility: Functional interfaces are designed to be compatible with lambda expressions, allowing developers to represent instances of 
single-method interfaces with a compact syntax.

@FunctionalInterface Annotation: While not required, it's common practice to annotate functional interfaces with @FunctionalInterface. This annotation ensures
that the interface contains exactly one abstract method, and if it contains more than one abstract method, it will result in a compilation error.

A Predicate is a functional interface that represents a boolean-valued function of one argument

A Function is a functional interface that represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.

A Consumer is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.

A Supplier is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results.

Optional is a container object introduced in Java 8 that can hold a value or be empty. It is used to represent optional values and helps avoid null checks, 
making the code more readable and less error-prone.

Optional can be used to handle nullable values more gracefully and avoid NullPointerExceptions in Java.

Date Time API
API is comprehensive and offers many more classes and methods to handle date and time operations effectively.

LocalDate - Represents a date without a time zone (e.g., 2024-06-03).
LocalTime -Represents a time without a time zone (e.g., 14:30:00).
LocalDateTime - Represents a date and time without a time zone (e.g., 2024-06-03T14:30:00)
ZonedDateTime - Represents a date and time with a time zone (e.g., 2024-06-03T14:30:00+02:00[Europe/Paris])
Period: Represents a date-based amount of time (e.g., 3 years, 2 months, 1 day).
Duration: Represents a time-based amount of time (e.g., 5 hours, 30 minutes).




Collections:
map
map is a transformation operation that applies a function to each element of a stream and returns a new stream consisting of the results of applying the function 
to each element.
It transforms each element individually, and the result is a one-to-one mapping between the elements of the original stream and the elements of the resulting stream.
The mapping function passed to map must return a value of the same type or subtype, as it performs a one-to-one transformation.

flatMap
flatMap is a transformation operation similar to map, but it is used when each element of the original stream contains another stream or collection of elements.
It flattens the elements of nested streams or collections into a single stream. Instead of producing a stream of streams or collections, it produces a single 
flat stream.
The mapping function passed to flatMap must return a stream or collection, and it combines the elements of all the streams or collections returned by
the mapping function into a single stream.

reduce
reduce is a terminal operation that combines all elements of a stream into a single result by repeatedly applying a binary operator.
It takes an initial value (also known as the identity) and a binary operator as parameters. The binary operator is applied to each element of the stream 
along with the accumulated result from previous operations.
The result of reduce can be of a different type than the elements of the stream. For example, you can use it to calculate the sum of all elements, 
find the maximum element, concatenate strings, etc.

WeakHashMap:
which allows you to store key-value pairs. It is similar to HashMap, but it uses weak references for its keys, meaning that if a key is not referenced anywhere 
else in the program and is only referenced by the WeakHashMap, it may be garbage collected.

IdentityHashMap:
IdentityHashMap is a specialized implementation of the Map interface that uses reference equality (instead of object equality) when comparing keys. 
This means that it compares keys using the == operator rather than the equals() method.


Fail-Fast Collections
Fail-fast iterators throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the underlying collection is structurally modified after the iterator is created.
These collections are designed to immediately detect and prevent concurrent modifications during iteration.
Examples of fail-fast collections include ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, etc.


Fail-Safe Collections
Fail-safe iterators do not throw ConcurrentModificationException even if the underlying collection is modified during iteration.
These collections make a copy of the underlying data structure (e.g., array) when the iterator is created, and the iteration is performed on this copied data structure.
Examples of fail-safe collections include ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet, etc.

Fail-Fast Collections: Immediate detection and throwing of ConcurrentModificationException during iteration if the collection is modified.
Fail-Safe Collections: Iteration is performed on a copied data structure, allowing modification during iteration without throwing exceptions.

Comparable Interface
The Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects.
It contains a single method compareTo() that compares the current object with another object.
Classes that implement Comparable can be sorted using the Collections.sort() method or by calling Arrays.sort().

Comparator Interface
The Comparator interface is used to define custom sorting orders for objects.
It contains a single method compare() that compares two objects.
Comparator instances are often used to sort objects in cases where the class itself does not implement Comparable, or when you want to use multiple sorting 
orders for the same class.

Comparable provides a way to define the natural ordering of objects within the class itself, while Comparator allows for defining custom sorting orders externally,
without modifying the class itself. Both interfaces are widely used for sorting objects in Java collections.
